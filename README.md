# Gig-Chaser

GigChaser is an app that two other team members and I collaborated to build for concert-goers and travelers as a one stop shop to get information about any band’s upcoming tour dates and venue locations. It provides quick access to a band’s top songs, tour dates, maps of the venue, and things to do nearby. 

Input a band name and date range to see upcoming tour dates and other extras.

Tech used: APIs from Google Maps, BandsInTown, LastFM, and YouTube.
